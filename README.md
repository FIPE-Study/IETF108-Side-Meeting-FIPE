### **Goal**
The goal of this unofficial side meeting is to make progress on defining research challenges and problems related to Future Internet Protocol Evolution (FIPE) that are not already better covered by other IRTF RG. We welcome any proposals and discussions to that end. 

### **Agenda**

**Part1: Deployment incentives, interworking, and gateways between networks with different addressing semantics**
- Various networks, such as IoT networks, industry networks, satellite networks, etc.
- Interconnection of heterogeneous networks
- Challenges/Problems to Internet Protocols

1.1 Routing and Traffic Engineering Challenges for Space-based Networking in Future Internet (25 mins)

Speaker: Daniel King, Lancaster University

1.2 The Multi-semantics of Addressing (20 mins)

Speaker: Stewart Bryant, University of Surrey and Futurewei


**Part2: E2E high-precision on latency assurance and multi-channel coordination** 
- New services, such as online meeting, 3D, VR/AR, holographic, etc. 
- Challenges/Problems on IP layer, transport layer, data plane, etc.

2.1 New Requirements for Time-Engineered Holographic Teleportation over Internet (20 mins)
